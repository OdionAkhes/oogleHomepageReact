Component breakdown analysis:

After visiting the Google homepage, I can identify the following main components:

Header- Contains the Google logo and the search bar
Search-Contains the input field and the search button
Main Content: Contains search results and related information
Footer- Contains links to other Google services and information

Each of these components can be further broken down into subcomponents:

a. Header Component
Logo Component
HeaderLinks Component(Apps, Images, SignIn)
Avatar
b. SearchBar Component

SearchInput component
SearchButtons Component(GoogleSearch, ImFeelingLucky)
Buttons
Languages Offered
c. Footer
Footer Text
FooterLinks


To demonstrate the use of states, I would add a state to the SearchBar Component that stores the search keyword entered by the user. Then, I would add an event listener to the input field that updates the state with the current value of the input field every time the user types something. Finally, I would add an event listener to the search button and/or the 'Enter' key that displays the search keyword directly under the SearchBar Component# oogleHomepageReact
